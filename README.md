# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the exponentiation of a number.
Developed by: Koduru Sanath Kumar Reddy
RegisterNumber: 21000648
base = int(input())
power = int(input())
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",base**power)
*/
git 

```

## Output:


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
